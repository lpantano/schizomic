=========

sites to place last publications, studies about schizophrenia from psychology to psychiatry. It starts as personal site but it is more than welcome any pull request. The wiki page is great for explanation, but the idea of this repository is to have a structured place to have the latest studies all together. I wil start to divide into:

* genetic discoveries
* psycological discoveries
* diagnosis
* treatment

## definition
