* 2014 (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24342994) molecular confirmation of the genetic overlap between SCZ and general cognitive ability
* 2014 LARGE (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24349030)  plos one , cognitive functions share genetic factors with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder

## SV


### deletions
