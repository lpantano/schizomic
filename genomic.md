## SNPs

### meta-analysis

* 2014 Am J  LARGE Psychiatric, (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25219520), The authors identified 42 SNP sets associated with a 70% or greater risk of schizophrenia, and confirmed 34 (81%) or more with similar high risk of schizophrenia in two independent samples.
* 2014 LARGE Mol Psychiatric, (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24342994), molecular confirmation of the genetic overlap between SCZ and general cognitive ability
* 2014 LARGE PLoS One, (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24349030), cognitive functions share genetic factors with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder
*2014 LARGE Hum Genet, (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25284466), top three methylation findings near genes SDCCAG8, CREB1 and ATXN7 in an independent sample using targeted pyrosequencing
*2014 LARGE Schizophr Res, (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25311781), There is a fourteen fold-increased risk of psychosis and a sixteen fold increased risk of schizophrenia in individuals with micro-duplication at proximal 16p11.2

## SV


### deletions

* 2014 (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25270547), deletion in mtDNA is lower in SZ but can be due to side effects of antipsychotic drugs 

### variants

* 2014, SMALL, Neurol Sci,  (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25283873), a significant interaction effect of COMT and STH polymorphisms on cognitive performances
* 2014, MEDIUM, Acta Neuropsychiatric, (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25287875), substantially increased risk for sex(male)-onset schizophrenia by IL1RN2 variant (RS 1794068) in tunnisian population
* 2014, MEDIUM, Transl Psychiatry, (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25335168), rs4654899: an intronic SNP of EIF4G3 was found associated with the right SFG volume (regulating HP1BP3 and CAPN14)
* 2014, MEDIUM, Int J Mol Sci, (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25347278), rs6943555 (AUTS2) was determined to be associated with female SCZ. 
* 2014, LARGE, Schizophr bull, (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25380769),  We found that MKL1 physically interacts with GSK3B, a protein encoded by a well-characterized schizophrenia susceptibility gene. Collectively, our results revealed that genetic variants in MKL1 might confer risk to schizophrenia.
* 2014, MEDIUM, Plos one, (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25393624),  L59P-PTPRA missense mutations, was only observed among patients of schizophrenia
* 2014, LARGE, Schizopht bull, (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25392519), the PGRS was significantly higher in patients compared with healthy controls.  related to differences in frontal lobe brain activation between high and low working memory demand. 
* 2014, SMALL, Mol Psychiatry, (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25403839), increased mRNA expression of CACNA1C in iNs homozygous for the risk genotype (rs1006737)
### Methylation
* 2014, SMALL, Pharmacology,(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25358668), The present study supports the hypothesis that impairment in the promoter region of GSTT and GSTP genes by hypermethylation may increase the risk of schizophrenia.
* 2014, SMALL, (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25420024), this study provides a list of 18 putative candidate genes for sporadic SCZ, and when combined with the results of similar reports, identifies a second proband carrying a non-synonymous DNV in the RGS12 gene
* 2014, MEDIUM, (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25416705), Our results suggest that reduced transcription and mTOR-regulated translation of certain DPYSL2 isoforms increase the risk for schizophrenia.3-SNP haplotype in the proximal promoter, two SNPs in intron 1, and a polymorphic dinucleotide repeat in the 5'-UTR which alters sequences predicted to be involved in translational regulation by mTOR signaling.
* 2104, LARGE, (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25429046?), In genes associated with the control of miRNAs, there are approximately 50% more RVs in SZ cases than in controls (P â‰¤ 2.62E-10). dysregulation of miRNA systems resulting in the abnormal upregulation of genome transcription in the development of SZ
* 2015, 25653350, the mice exhibited SZ-like behavioral abnormalities with Synaptic Scaffolding Molecule CNV

# Epigenomic

## CpGs

* 2014, MEDIUM, (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25424713), 432 CpG sites with differential methylation levels that are associated with differential gene expression. SNP rs11191514:C>T, which regulates DNA methylation of calcium homeostasis modulator 1 that is also associated with differential gene expression in patients
