## Vitamins
immune molecules
* 2014,SMALL, Schizophr Res, (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25311777),  The results showed that 91% (20) had deficient or insufficient Vitamin D levels.low vitamin D levels with increased cellular aging in females

## Infections
* 2014, LARGE, Schizophr bull, (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25385789), There was a significant increase in risk of positive T. gondii IgM antibodies in acute psychosis compared with controls. there was a significant association with geographic region

## Neurosteroids

* 2014, SMALL, Crisi , (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25410258),  pregnenolone was significantly decreased in the parietal cortex in the combined group of patients with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder who died by suicide (n = 13) compared with patients with these disorders who died of other causes (n = 17, p = .02). 

## immune molecules
* 2015, MEDIUM, 23934781, we were capable of separating schizophrenia patients into 2 significantly distinct subgroups with predominant molecular abnormalities in either immune molecules or growth factors and hormones
* 2015, SMALL, 25827958, It appears that increased level of IL-23 in psychotic patients independently of antipsychotic therapy can be a constitutive marker in this disorder.
* 2015, SMALL, 25834440, None of the investigated patients with an FEP and none of the healthy controls showed positive antibodies against NMDA-Rs.
