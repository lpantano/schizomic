# brain sections

* 2014, NA, 25261565, pPOS were characterized by pronounced gray matter (GM) volume reductions in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), which herein is defined to include the orbitofrontal cortex, and in occipitotemporal GM and parts of the lingual gyrus. 
* brain's cortex develop differently in people with schizophrenia, mainly at cingulo-fronto-temporal section (http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biopsych.2014.02.010). The study was done in Childhood-onset schizophrenia (COS), that is a very rare form of schizophrenia that starts before age 13.
* 2014, SMALL, Biol Psychiatric , (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25281999), NMDAR antagonist administration increase hyperconnectivity, but has no effect in chronic illness. 
* 2014, SMALL, Psychiatric Res (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25288478), positive correlations were found between levels of social anhedonia and the thickness of the postcentral and the inferior parietal gyri
* 2014, SMALL, Schizophr Res, (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25308834), vulnerability to schizophrenia includes smaller hippocampi and DMN suppression deficits, and these are associated with poorer WM. 
* 2014, SMALL, Neuroimage Clin, (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25379425), The results of our study suggest a graded expression of verbal learning deficits accompanied by structural alterations within the hippocampus in BD patients and SZ patients, with SZ patients being more strongly affected.
* 2015, NA, Front Hum Neurosci,(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25566030), The loss of the cerebral torque and the abnormalities of gyrification, with an increased or more complex cortical folding in the right hemisphere may provide an anatomical basis for such aberrant connectivity in SCZ.
* 2015, SMALL, Psychiatry Res, (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25612462),  deficits of amplitude for motor rotation were positively correlated with positive symptom scores in SCZ.
* 2015, SMALL, 25682180, Analyses revealed that patients with SZ are characterized by a significant reduced top-down endogenous connectivity from DLPFC to Amy
* 2015, SMALL, 24927685, Healthy individuals showed the strongest correlation between social competence and activation of right hemisphere structures involved in social cognitive processing, whereas in patients, the correlation pattern was lateralized to left hemisphere areas

## prefontal cortex
*2014, SMALL, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25379453,Significantly lower GABA/Cr ratios were found in patients with schizophrenia in the prefrontal cortex as compared to healthy controls, with GABA/Cr ratios inversely correlated with cognitive functioning in the patients.
* 2014, NA, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25420610, Blocking GABAA receptors, but not inhibiting cortical GABA synthesis, within the medial PFC affects decision-making in the rGT. 
* 2015, SMALL, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25568120, early-course schizophrenia involves increased PFC glutamate, which might elevate PFC functional connectivity

## Cingulum bundle
*2014, SMALL, Schizophr Res, (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25311780), structural damage to the cingulum bundle may be involved in the etiology of delusions of control

## substantia nigra
*2014, SMALL, Schizophr Res, (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25266549), We found substantia nigra hyperactivity associated with prefrontal hypofunction and prefrontonigral functional disconnectivity, as well as the magnitude of nigrostriatal functional connectivity positively correlating with severity of psychosis. 

## Grey matter
* 2014, SMALL, Neuropsychobiology, (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25358262), Patients with LOS and EOS showed decreased GM volumes in the right insula, left superior temporal gyrus and left orbitofrontal gyrus compared with healthy subjects. A longer duration of illness was associated with reduced GM volume in the temporal pole in patients with EOS.

## temporal gyrus
* 2014, SMALL, Schizophrenia res, (http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.schres.2014.10.042), When compared with the healthy control group, both patient groups showed significantly reduced M100 and M200 source strength in both hemispheres and a symmetric M100 and M200 source pattern

## cerebellum
