> pPOS were characterized by pronounced gray matter (GM) volume reductions in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), which herein is defined to include the orbitofrontal cortex, and in occipitotemporal GM and parts of the lingual gyrus. pNEG was found to have vmPFC reduction but to a lesser degree than pPOS and with a relative sparing of the more medial vmPFC regions, compared to pDIS; it also had significantly less cerebellar GM. pDIS showed relatively highest GM volume preservation among three subtypes.

* brain's cortex develop differently in people with schizophrenia, mainly at cingulo-fronto-temporal section (http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biopsych.2014.02.010). The study was done in Childhood-onset schizophrenia (COS), that is a very rare form of schizophrenia that starts before age 13.

* 2014 SMALL Schizophr Res, (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25308834), vulnerability to schizophrenia includes smaller hippocampi and DMN suppression deficits, and these are associated with poorer WM.
