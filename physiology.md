* Different subtypes affecting different sections

> pPOS were characterized by pronounced gray matter (GM) volume reductions in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), which herein is defined to include the orbitofrontal cortex, and in occipitotemporal GM and parts of the lingual gyrus. pNEG was found to have vmPFC reduction but to a lesser degree than pPOS and with a relative sparing of the more medial vmPFC regions, compared to pDIS; it also had significantly less cerebellar GM. pDIS showed relatively highest GM volume preservation among three subtypes.
* brain's cortex develop differently in people with schizophrenia, mainly at cingulo-fronto-temporal section (http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biopsych.2014.02.010). The study was done in Childhood-onset schizophrenia (COS), that is a very rare form of schizophrenia that starts before age 13.
* 2014, SMALL, Biol Psychiatric , (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25281999), NMDAR antagonist administration increase hyperconnectivity, but has no effect in chronic illness. 
* 2014, SMALL, Psychiatric Res (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25288478), positive correlations were found between levels of social anhedonia and the thickness of the postcentral and the inferior parietal gyri
* 2014, SMALL, Schizophr Res, (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25308834), vulnerability to schizophrenia includes smaller hippocampi and DMN suppression deficits, and these are associated with poorer WM. 

## Cingulum bundle
*2014, SMALL, Schizophr Res, (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25311780), structural damage to the cingulum bundle may be involved in the etiology of delusions of control

## substantia nigra

*2014, SMALL, Schizophr Res, (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25266549), We found substantia nigra hyperactivity associated with prefrontal hypofunction and prefrontonigral functional disconnectivity, as well as the magnitude of nigrostriatal functional connectivity positively correlating with severity of psychosis.
