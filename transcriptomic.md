## Genes

### mice models

* 2014,NA, ,(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24321452), DTNBP enhances fast excitatory glutamatergic transmission mediated by AMPA receptors in hippocampal CA3-CA1 synapses. These data provide compelling evidence that dysbindin, a widely suspected susceptibility protein in schizophrenia, is important for AMPAR-mediated synaptic transmission and plasticity in the developing hippocampus. 
* 2014,NA,Plos One, (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25340473),abnormal sleep and certain (endo)phenotypes of psychiatric diseases may be caused by common mechanisms involving components of the molecular clock including SHARP1 and SHARP2

## miRNAs

* 2014 (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25084801) rs66642155 allelic variant of miRNA137 appears to influence age at onset and the severity of positive symptoms

## mRNA

* 2014 (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25270546)  A significant decrease in GCH1 mRNA levels was observed in FEP (first episodes psychosis) patients relative to controls. This difference remains after treatment and it was correlated to methylation of its promoter

* 2014 NA stem cell report , high level of catecholamine in iPSC Neurons from skin of schizophrenic people , 2F+1M vs 2M+1F, http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.stemcr.2014.08.001

* 2014 SMALL J Psychiatric Res, (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25282281), deregulation of OR and TASR gene expression in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in schizophrenia (inversely associated with the daily chlorpromazine dose). 

* 2014 NA J Neurosc, (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25297099) the function of dysbindin in the dynamic morphogenesis of dendritic protrusions, and reveal the essential roles of dysbindin and CaMKIIÎ± in the stabilization of dendritic protrusions during neuronal development. 

* 2014 SMALL, BMC Psychiatry, (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25292222), GluN2B protein levels were decreased by 43% in the left hemisphere of schizophrenia subjects compared to controls 

* 2014, SMALL, Schizophrenia res, (http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.schres.2014.10.031), suggest that higher mRNA levels for CXCR7, may represent a compensatory mechanism to sustain the migration and correct positioning of cortical parvalbumin and somatostatin GABA neurons 

* 2104, SMALL, Schizophrenia res, (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25487697), These genes were used in co-expression analysesthat revealed the pairs CCR1/SERPINA1, CCR5/HCST, C1QA/CD68, CCR5/S100A11 and SERPINA1/TLR1 as presenting the most significant difference in co-expression between SZ and BD.all having a role in the communication of environmental factors to the cells and associated to microglia

* 2015, NA, 25689573,  increased levels of D-aspartate in D-aspartate oxidase -/- animals can significantly inhibit functional circuits activated by phencyclidine, and affect the development of cortico-hippocampal connectivity networks potentially involved in schizophrenia
