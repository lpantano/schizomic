* DTNBP enhances fast excitatory glutamatergic transmission mediated by AMPA receptors in hippocampal CA3-CA1 synapses  (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24321452)

These data provide compelling evidence that dysbindin, a widely suspected susceptibility protein in schizophrenia, is important for AMPAR-mediated synaptic transmission and plasticity in the developing hippocampus.
