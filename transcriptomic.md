## Genes

### mice models

* 2014 DTNBP enhances fast excitatory glutamatergic transmission mediated by AMPA receptors in hippocampal CA3-CA1 synapses  (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24321452)

These data provide compelling evidence that dysbindin, a widely suspected susceptibility protein in schizophrenia, is important for AMPAR-mediated synaptic transmission and plasticity in the developing hippocampus. 

## miRNAs

* 2014 (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25084801) rs66642155 allelic variant of miRNA137 appears to influence age at onset and the severity of positive symptoms

## mRNA

* 2014 (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25270546)  A significant decrease in GCH1 mRNA levels was observed in FEP (first episodes psychosis) patients relative to controls. This difference remains after treatment and it was correlated to methylation of its promoter

* 2014 NA stem cell report , high level of catecholamine in iPSC Neurons from skin of schizophrenic people , 2F+1M vs 2M+1F, http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.stemcr.2014.08.001
