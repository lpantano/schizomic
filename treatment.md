### positive symptoms

* CBRT  as novel treatment for voice hearing (http://www.schizophreniaresearch.org.au/research-news/new-therapy-may-assist-voice-hearers/)
> Cognitive Behavioural Relating Therapy (CBRT) is a novel treatment developed by Perth-based psychologist Dr Georgie Paulik that aims to improve how people relate to the voices they hear, as well as other people socially, and decrease the amount of distress caused by persistent voice-hearing.

###negative symptoms

* 2014 NA Behav Brain Res, (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25300471), the stimulation of the NMDA receptor through the glycine site on the receptor either directly with D-serine or by blocking glycine transporter-1 attenuates the immobility elicited by the subchronic administration of MK-801 and may be potentially useful for the treatment of negative symptoms of schizophrenia
* 2014 SMALL, Neuropsychopharmacology, (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25308351), nicotine intake might stabilise the impaired inhibition-facilitation balance in the schizophrenic brain through a complex interaction between cortical plasticity, and GABAergic and cholinergic neurotransmission
### News
*2014, SMALL, Glob J Health Sci, (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25363186), we found that supplemental omega-3 might increase efficacy of conventional antipsychotics in decreasing symptoms of schizophrenia

### consequences

* 2014 SMALL Eur J Clin Pharmacol, (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25291992), These results indicate that second-generation antipsychotics may influence OCM (body mass index (BMI), serum levels of total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoproteins (LDL), triglycerides (TG) and tHcy), especially in first-episode schizophrenia (FES) males.
* 2014 NA Pharmacopsychiatry, (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25295553), Both patients experienced falls and consequently bone fractures
* 2014 LARGE Psychiatr Q, (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25294277), 20 % of patients were in the worst health state (HS + Dp + Ak), with greater decreases at 6 months in this health state for perphenazine (9.2 % decrease) and olanzapine (11.1 %) groups compared to risperidone (4.7 %) and quetiapine (6.7 %) 
* 2014 MEDIUM Psychiatric Genet, (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25304228), presence of the 120-bp duplication in DRD4 appears to confer a risk for sialorrhea in response to clozapine therapy.
* 2014 NA Psychiatric Genet, (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25304226), inverse correlation between the baseline BMI and change in BMI during long-term clozapine use in patients with schizophrenia, and the LEP-2548A/G polymorphism was associated significantly with both these measures.
* 2014, SMALL, Rom J Morphol Embryol,(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25329115),The CYP2D6 genotype in children and adolescents with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, proved to be a good predictor for the response to atypical antipsychotics and the side effects registered. 
* 2014, SMALL, J Psychopharmacol,(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25336715),olanzapine-induced inflammation and adiposity are closely related
* 2015, SMALL, Plos one, (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24710015),analysis showed significant relationships between changes (after risperidone treatment) in APOA-1 and changes in triglyceride, total cholesterol, and body mass index

## resistence
*2014, SMALL, Res Schizophrenia,(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25278103),treatment with high-dose olanzapine (>20â€…mg/day) appears to be a good alternative to clozapine

## revision

*2014, LARGE, Pharmacogenomics,(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25340730), Across three psychiatric disorders (n = 2815 patients), we observed no consistent association between SULT4A1-1 status and atypical antipsychotic effect
