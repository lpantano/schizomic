### positive symptoms

* CBRT  as novel treatment for voice hearing (http://www.schizophreniaresearch.org.au/research-news/new-therapy-may-assist-voice-hearers/)
> Cognitive Behavioural Relating Therapy (CBRT) is a novel treatment developed by Perth-based psychologist Dr Georgie Paulik that aims to improve how people relate to the voices they hear, as well as other people socially, and decrease the amount of distress caused by persistent voice-hearing.

###negative symptoms

* 2014 NA Behav Brain Res, (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25300471), the stimulation of the NMDA receptor through the glycine site on the receptor either directly with D-serine or by blocking glycine transporter-1 attenuates the immobility elicited by the subchronic administration of MK-801 and may be potentially useful for the treatment of negative symptoms of schizophrenia


## consequences
* 2014 SMALL Eur J Clin Pharmacol, (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25291992), These results indicate that second-generation antipsychotics may influence OCM (body mass index (BMI), serum levels of total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoproteins (LDL), triglycerides (TG) and tHcy), especially in first-episode schizophrenia (FES) males.
* 2014 NA Pharmacopsychiatry, (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25295553), Both patients experienced falls and consequently bone fractures
* 2014 LARGE Psychiatr Q, (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25294277), 20 % of patients were in the worst health state (HS + Dp + Ak), with greater decreases at 6 months in this health state for perphenazine (9.2 % decrease) and olanzapine (11.1 %) groups compared to risperidone (4.7 %) and quetiapine (6.7 %)
